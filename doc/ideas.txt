% Recipes:
%  - algorithms
%  - usually: humans->computers here: computers->humans!
%  - similar to programming languages
% 
% Novelty:
%  - combine new ingrediences to new things
% Usefulness:
%  - make sure ingrediences fit together
%  - make sure processes fit together
%  -> ... "type inference"
% 
% Stage 0: Database Layer
% 	Mongodb [mongodb]
% 	 - Robomongo db gui
% 	 - mongoengine [python-mongoengine]
% 
% Stage 1: Document Retrieval
% 	Fetch recipe index
% 	Fetch recipes
% 	 - e.g. from wikibooks
% 
% Stage 2: Language Processing
% 	Information retrieval
% 	 - process document parts:
% 		- name
% 		- ingredience list
% 		- recipe text
% 		- categories
% 	 - dictionary based and
% 	 - NLTK [python-nltk]
% 		- POS tagging
% 		- chunking
% 
% 	CHALLENGES:
% 	- get rid of noise
% 
% Stage 3: Semantic Model
% 	- identify techniques, ingrediences and tools (by category)
% 	- model sentence parts as procedural operations
% 	  - has to be done by hand for most operations
% 	  - maybe use "techniques" category: most techniques are unary + inline
% 	- also find a way to model the results of the operation
% 	  - idea so far: use sets like {{potatoes, chopped}, {spinach, washed}}
% 	  - trees would be more powerful but also more difficult to handle by the following steps
% 
% 	CHALLENGES:
% 	- understand as many documents as possible with as little
% 	  manual work as possible
% 
% Stage 4: Analysis
% 	- use data mining algorithms to find common rules (e.g. a priori algorithm)
% 	- find typical processes
% 	- find similar ingrediences, tools or actions
% 	  - direct comparison "on demand"
% 	  - or clustering and extended rules replacing ingrediences by their clusters
% 
% 	use (maybe): [numpy], [sciklearn]
% 
% 	CHALLENGES:
% 	- get the parameters right (e.g. support and confidence levels)
% 
% Stage 5: Be creative
% 	- Start with a set of ingrediences
% 	- combine ingrediences according to the rules
% 	- consider switching out similar ingrediences
% 	- terminate when a valid end state is found
% 	- strip the recipe of unneeded steps, tools and ingrediences
% 
% 	CHALLENGES:
% 	- hope that the model will work
% 	- get the probabilities right for
% 	  - exchanging ingrediences
% 	  - rule probability curve
% 
% Bonus:
% 	- Estimate difficulty and preparation time
% 	- Determine fitting categories
