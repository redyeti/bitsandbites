Random: How to implement random = weighted roulette wheel in mongo?

* Start with a random FINALIZE rule
* Analyze input set rule: 
  - store properties in the node
  - follow the properties ordered by index DESC,
    where index is the average max-distance from the leaves
  - try to satisfy property with max(index - depth)
* Repeat: depending on the depth of the recipe, add or replace rules

     |______________
     |              \
     |               \
     |_______________ \________________________
     0             a   b

     [0..a): only add node, if possible
     [a..b): add or replace node
        b  : replace node

     a = MAXDEPTH < index(FINALIZE) <  b = MINDEPTH
e.g.       2                               10

    If all rules are satisfied, rate the recipe, based on scores:
    Big scores are positive, low scores are negative!
    TOTAL SCORE						= U * N (And some constraints!)
	- U -> Usefulness:				= (IC + IH + RV) / 3
		- IC -> Ingredience Co-Occurrence	= pairs_i_cooc / pairs_i_totals
		- IH -> Ingredience Histogram		= 0.5 + min([cosine similarity])/2
		- RV -> Rule Violation			= (satisfied_bwd + 1) / (all_bwd + 1)
	- N -> Novelty:					= RR
		- RR -> Recipe Repitition		= 1 - min([normalized compression distance])
